Hi,my friend.I’m the one who ask the question about RobotGeometry On YouTube.

At first,I’d like to express my respect for you.I have searched lots of Open Source items about RobotArm.The RobotArm which your made is very COOL,it’s very important that the project includes RobotGeometry(A PDF file of your drawing&analysied).That’s I want to learn about.

Here are some questions that I want to consult.
